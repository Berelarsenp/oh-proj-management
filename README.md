Draft web app Open Humans projects can use to view and work with members and data

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

If you have a project, you should try using the master token for that. But if not, here's a demo master token you can use. (The demo project has very little sample data, but maybe we'll be able to expand that.) `XitlFDXBqm5TRK8Vuh3Ey2cDFdiTWz7amKpot97H9Xfgak1qpvray0b0arQhvpEP`


## Background

Read [this issue string](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans/issues/690) for background on potential project goals, which includes or achieves some of the following:

* Online dashboard view for project admins
* Enables multiple people (user accounts) to admin a project, without requiring a single shared user account to admin projects
* Ability to create the command (complete with an updated project auth token) for admins to copy/paste and run on the command line, cutting down on human error when downloading project data
* Ability to create unlimited number of white/black lists, to be able to create project-specific lists, in addition to weeding out non-legitimate participants. (TBD about whether these participants are actually removed from a project/not; notified/not/etc)
